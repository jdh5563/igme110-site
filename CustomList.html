            <h2>Custom List Class</h2>
            <p>This program is essentially one class that replicates the functionality of C#'s generic List Class. This was assigned as homework in my intro game development class to help us understand how a List operates. I have been able to use this custom class to my advantage because it has all the functionality of the normal List class, but I also have the freedom to add other functions that I may need.</p>
