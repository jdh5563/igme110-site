            <h2>Space Shifter</h2>
            <p>Space Shifter is my first real large scale project that I am working on. This is a fast-paced racing game where each player is challenged to propel themselves forward while simultaneously trying to keep their opponent at bay. I designed this game with the help of my roommate Sevan who is also a passionate game developer. Together we plan to turn this into a fantastic ongoing project.</p>
